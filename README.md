Summary
•	Bi-directional relationships: Nearly all of the relationships in the LMS are bi-directional, meaning that both entities are aware of their connection to each other. This allows for flexible querying and better navigation through the data model.
•	Uni-directional relationships: There are no strictly uni-directional relationships in this design because it’s typically beneficial for both entities to have knowledge of each other in a system like an LMS, where the relationships are closely interconnected.

Mapping & Directionality
The relationships between these tables, with the AI-specific enhancements, would remain mostly bi-directional, allowing both entities in each relationship to be aware of and interact with each other. The AI-related tables, however, will primarily interact with the core tables (like Users, Courses, Submissions, etc.) in a uni-directional manner, where AI tables provide insights or suggestions without requiring reciprocal data.
1.	Users ↔ AI_Content_Recommendations: Bi-directional
o	Explanation: Users receive recommendations, and their engagement with the content influences future AI suggestions.
2.	Courses ↔ AI_Analytics: Bi-directional
o	Explanation: Courses generate data that AI analyzes to predict outcomes, which then influence course adjustments.
3.	Submissions ↔ AI_Feedback: Uni-directional
o	Explanation: AI provides feedback based on submissions, but submissions don't affect the AI table.
4.	Users ↔ AI_Chatbot_Interactions: Bi-directional
o	Explanation: Users interact with chatbots, and their interactions influence the chatbot’s future responses.
